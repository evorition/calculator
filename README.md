# calculator

This is a solution to the Calculator [project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator) from The Odin Project.

## Note
I tried to simulate behaviour from the default Windows 10 calculator. For example if you enter something like
```
8 x 8 =
```
And then press `=` repeatedly then you get the following output:
```
8 x 8 =
64
8 x 64 =
512
8 x 512 =
4096
```
